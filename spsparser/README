A parser which takes logfiles generated by ffmpeg including a binary dump of
the NAL units of the SPS and PPS of an h264 stream.
Using the h264bitstream library to find the NAL units and decompose them into
their composite syntax elements.
The h264bitstream library can be found here:
https://github.com/aizvorski/h264bitstream
This repo contains instructions on installing it. This parser needs to know
where the included h264_stream.h and bs.h files are, assuming a subdirectory of
this repository.

To build this tool:
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make

An example log file (in this case 'sps_parser_test.txt' might contain the line:

[h264_vkapi @ 0x55a298770e00] Raw SPS/PPS: \x0\x0\x1\x67\x42\xe0\x15\x8d\x66\xb\x13\x90\x0\x0\x0\x1\x68\xce\x38\x80\x0

Example usage of this tool would be:
$ ./sps_pps_parser sps_parser_test.txt

The tool would then find the sps and pps elements within that log and report to
STDOUT the present syntax elements

This report can also be stored in an output file by adding the -o argument
